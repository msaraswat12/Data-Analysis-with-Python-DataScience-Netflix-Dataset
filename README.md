# Data Analysis Project: Exploring Netflix Dataset ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“Š
Introduction:
In this project, I delved into a comprehensive analysis of a Netflix dataset using Python's powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries. The objective was to gain insights into the content available on Netflix and answer various intriguing questions.
Dataset Exploration:
To kick off our exploration, I utilized common DataFrame commands to understand the structure and content of the dataset.

The commands that we used in this project :

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")

# head() - It shows the first N rows in the data (by default, N=5).
df_head = df.head()

# tail() - It shows the last N rows in the data (by default, N=5).
df_tail = df.tail()

# shape - It shows the total no. of rows and no. of columns of the dataframe.
df_shape = df.shape

# size - To show No. of total values(elements) in the dataset.
df_size = df.size

# columns - To show each Column Name.
df_columns = df.columns

# dtypes - To show the data-type of each column.
df_dtypes = df.dtypes

# info() - To show indexes, columns, data-types of each column, memory at once.
df_info = df.info()

# value_counts - In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count.
# It can be applied on a single column only.
value_counts_col = df['Col_name'].value_counts()

# unique() - It shows the all unique values of the series.
unique_col = df['Col_name'].unique()

# nunique() - It shows the total no. of unique values in the series.
nunique_col = df['Col_name'].nunique()

# duplicated( ) - To check row wise and detect the Duplicate rows.
duplicated_rows = df[df.duplicated()]

# isnull( ) - To show where Null value is present.
is_null = df.isnull()

# dropna( ) - It drops the rows that contain all missing values.
df_dropna = df.dropna()

# isin( ) - To show all records including particular elements.
isin_records = df[df['Col_name'].isin(['value1', 'value2'])]

# str.contains( ) - To get all records that contain a given string.
contains_string_records = df[df['Col_name'].str.contains('substring')]

# str.split( ) - It splits a column's string into different columns.
df_split = df['Col_name'].str.split(expand=True)

# to_datetime( ) - Converts the data-type of Date-Time Column into datetime[ns] datatype.
df['date_column'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_column'])

# dt.year.value_counts( ) - It counts the occurrence of all individual years in the Time column.
year_counts = df['date_column'].dt.year.value_counts()

# groupby( ) - Groupby is used to split the data into groups based on some criteria.
grouped_df = df.groupby('Col_name')

# sns.countplot(df['Col_name']) - To show the count of all unique values of any column in the form of a bar graph.
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.countplot(x=df['Col_name'])
plt.show()

# max( ), min( ) - It shows the maximum/minimum value of the series.
max_value = df['Col_name'].max()
min_value = df['Col_name'].min()

# mean( ) - It shows the mean value of the series.
mean_value = df['Col_name'].mean()

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")

# Task 1: Remove Duplicate Records
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Task 2: Check for Null Values and Display with Heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(df.isnull(), cmap='viridis', cbar=False)
plt.show()

# Q. 1: 'Jailbirds New Orleans' Show Information
jailbirds_info = df[df['title'] == "Jailbirds New Orleans"][['show_id', 'director']]

# Q. 2: Bar Graph for the Year with the Highest Number of Releases
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

plt.title("Number of TV Shows and Movies Released Each Year")
plt.xlabel("Release Year")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()

# Q. 3: Bar Graph for the Number of Movies and TV Shows
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))

r_rating_tv_shows = df[(df['type'] == 'TV Show') & (df['rating'] == 'R') & (df['release_year'] > 2018)].shape[0]
print(f"Number of TV Shows with 'R' rating after 2018: {r_rating_tv_shows}")

# Q. 10: What is the maximum duration of a Movie/Show on Netflix?
max_duration = df['duration'].str.extract('(\d+)').astype(float).max()

# Q. 11: Which individual country has the Highest No. of TV Shows?
top_country_tv_shows = df[df['type'] == 'TV Show']['country'].value_counts().idxmax()
print(f"Country with the Highest Number of TV Shows: {top_country_tv_shows}")

# Q. 12: How can we sort the dataset by Year?
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by='release_year')
print("Dataset Sorted by Year:")
print(sorted_df)

# Q. 13: Find all the instances where: type is 'Movie' and listed is 'Dramas' or type is 'TV Show' & listed_in is 'Kids' TV
filtered_instances = df[((df['type'] == 'Movie') & (df['listed_in'].str.contains('Dramas'))) |
